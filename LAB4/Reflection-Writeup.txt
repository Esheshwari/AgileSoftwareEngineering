This lab provided practical experience in understanding Adaptive Software Development (ASD) and how it differs from traditional project management approaches.
Through the Speculate-Collaborate–Learn (SCL) cycle, I understood that ASD focuses on flexibility, learning, and continuous improvement rather than rigid planning.
During the Speculate phase, assumptions were made about user behavior and system requirements, and these were intentionally marked as subject to change. 
In the Collaborate phase, stakeholder feedback was incorporated through discussions, comments, and sprint adjustments, demonstrating how teamwork and communication shape project outcomes. 
In the Learn phase, assumptions were evaluated, and backlog priorities were modified based on new insights.

This exercise showed that adaptive development is highly suitable for uncertain and dynamic environments where requirements evolve frequently. 
Unlike traditional planning, ASD embraces change and treats it as an opportunity to improve the product. 
Overall, the lab highlighted the importance of flexibility, collaboration, and continuous learning in modern software development practices.
