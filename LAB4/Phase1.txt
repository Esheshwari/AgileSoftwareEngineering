PHASE 1: UNDERSTANDING ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
Step 1: ASD Characteristics (Write in Word)
1️ Mission-Focused Development

ASD focuses on achieving the overall mission or business goal rather than strictly following detailed plans. The team concentrates on delivering value instead of just completing predefined tasks.

2️ Component-Based Development

Development is done in small, manageable components. Each component can be developed, tested, and improved independently, allowing flexibility and faster adjustments.

3️ Time-Boxed Iterations

Work is divided into fixed time periods (iterations). The team delivers the best possible output within the time limit rather than waiting for everything to be perfect.
4️ Risk-Driven and Change-Tolerant Planning

ASD accepts uncertainty and identifies risks early. Plans are flexible and adjusted as new information emerges instead of being rigid.

5️ Continuous Learning

Teams regularly review outcomes, gather feedback, and adapt. Learning from each iteration improves future decisions.

🔹 Why Traditional Planning Fails in Uncertain Environments

Traditional planning assumes requirements are stable and predictable. In uncertain environments, requirements change frequently, making fixed long-term plans ineffective. Rigid planning leads to delays, rework, and increased costs when changes occur.
